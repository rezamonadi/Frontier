In my presentation/write-up I will talk about the role of machine learning in astronomy. 
I will mention why we cannot move forward in the observational astronomy, due to the problems that big data is making for us,
 unless we practice machine learning methods. I will specifically talk about the importance of machine learning methods for 
 Square Kilometer Array project.  Finally, I will address the pitfalls which we should be aware of, if do not pay attention 
 to machine learning limitations.
